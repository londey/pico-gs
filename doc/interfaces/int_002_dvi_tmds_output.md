## Specification

### Overview

This project uses a subset of the DVI TMDS Output standard.

### Usage

DVI 1.0 specification for TMDS encoding at 640×480@60Hz.

## Project-Specific Usage

### Resolution and Timing

- **Resolution:** 640x480 @ 60 Hz (CEA-861 / standard VGA)
- **Pixel Clock:** 25.000 MHz (derived as clk_core / 4 from the unified 100 MHz GPU/SDRAM clock; 0.7% deviation from the 25.175 MHz VGA standard, within tolerance for virtually all monitors)
- **TMDS Bit Clock:** 250.0 MHz (10x pixel clock)

### Horizontal Timing (in pixel clocks)

| Parameter     | Value | Description          |
|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| H_DISPLAY     | 640   | Active video pixels  |
| H_FRONT       | 16    | Front porch          |
| H_SYNC        | 96    | Sync pulse width     |
| H_BACK        | 48    | Back porch           |
| H_TOTAL       | 800   | Total line period     |

### Vertical Timing (in lines)

| Parameter     | Value | Description          |
|---------------|-------|----------------------|
| V_DISPLAY     | 480   | Active video lines   |
| V_FRONT       | 10    | Front porch          |
| V_SYNC        | 2     | Sync pulse width     |
| V_BACK        | 33    | Back porch           |
| V_TOTAL       | 525   | Total frame period    |

### Sync Polarity

Both HSYNC and VSYNC are **active-low** (logic 0 during the sync pulse, logic 1 otherwise).

### TMDS Channel Assignment

Four differential pairs are output via the ECP5 FPGA:

| Pair          | Content                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `tmds_clk`    | Serialized pixel clock                   |
| `tmds_blue`   | Blue channel + HSYNC/VSYNC control bits  |
| `tmds_green`  | Green channel                            |
| `tmds_red`    | Red channel                              |

Each color channel is TMDS-encoded (8b/10b) and serialized 10:1 at the TMDS bit clock. HSYNC and VSYNC are embedded in the blue channel's control period during blanking intervals.

### Clock Generation

All display and memory clocks are generated by the FPGA PLL from a 50 MHz board oscillator:

| Clock | Frequency | Phase | Derivation |
|-------|-----------|-------|------------|
| `clk_core` | 100 MHz | 0° | PLL 2x from 50 MHz oscillator |
| `clk_pixel` | 25 MHz | 0° | clk_core / 4 (synchronous integer divider) |
| `clk_tmds` | 250 MHz | 0° | PLL 5x from 50 MHz oscillator (10x pixel clock) |
| `clk_sdram` | 100 MHz | 90° | PLL 2x from 50 MHz oscillator, 90° phase shift |

The pixel clock and core clock have a synchronous 4:1 relationship, which eliminates the need for asynchronous CDC between the display controller and the GPU core/SDRAM domain.

`clk_sdram` is the external clock driven to the W9825G6KH SDRAM chip.
The 90° phase shift relative to `clk_core` ensures that SDRAM output data is stable at the `clk_core` rising edge, compensating for PCB trace delay and SDRAM clock-to-output time (tAC).
Both `clk_core` and `clk_sdram` are generated by the same PLL, so their phase relationship is deterministic and jitter-free.

## Constraints

See external specification for full details.

## Notes

This is an external standard. Refer to the official specification for complete details.
The 25.000 MHz pixel clock deviates 0.7% from the 25.175 MHz VGA standard.
This is well within the typical monitor tolerance of +/- 0.5-2%, and has been validated with consumer HDMI displays.
