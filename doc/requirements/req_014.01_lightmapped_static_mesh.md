# REQ-014.01: Lightmapped Static Mesh

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When the render executor processes a mesh patch tagged as a lightmapped static mesh, the system SHALL configure the GPU with two texture units and the color combiner set to `(VERTEX_COLOR + TEX_COLOR0) * TEX_COLOR1`, where TEX0 is the diffuse texture and TEX1 is the lightmap.

## Rationale

Lightmapped static meshes are the primary render mode for static level geometry.
Two sets of UVs are used: one for the diffuse (albedo) texture and one for a pre-baked lightmap.
Vertex colors provide per-vertex dynamic point light contributions (up to 4 lights), which are added to the diffuse texture before modulation by the lightmap.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-014 (Render Modes)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline) — GPU-side dual-texture sampling and combiner evaluation
- UNIT-021 (Core 1 Render Executor) — host-side render command dispatch
- UNIT-022 (GPU Driver Layer) — combiner mode and texture unit register configuration

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-014 (Texture Memory Layout)
- INT-020 (GPU Driver API)

## Verification Method

**Test:** TBD

## Notes

Placeholder requirement — details to be refined during implementation planning.
