# REQ-011.03: Reliability Requirements

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Analysis

## Requirement

The system SHALL meet the reliability requirements defined in the specification.

## Rationale

These targets ensure the system meets performance, resource, and reliability expectations.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-011 (System Constraints)

## Allocated To

- All hardware and firmware units (system-wide)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-013 (GPIO Status Signals)

## Functional Requirements

### FR-052-1: Power-On Visual Self-Test

When the FPGA completes configuration and the PLL locks, the system SHALL autonomously render a visible boot screen that displays a Gouraud-shaded triangle with distinct vertex colors, without requiring host SPI communication.

## Verification Method

**Analysis:** Measure actual performance/resource usage against targets.

- [ ] Boot screen is visible on display output within one frame period after PLL lock
- [ ] Boot screen triangle displays correct Gouraud-shaded vertex colors (red, green, blue), confirming the pixel pipeline is functional
- [ ] Boot screen renders without any SPI traffic from the host, confirming autonomous operation

## Notes

Non-functional requirement. See specifications for specific numeric targets.

The boot screen (FR-052-1) serves as a visual self-test: it exercises the full rendering pipeline (command FIFO, register file, triangle setup, rasterizer, pixel pipeline, memory arbiter, SDRAM controller, display controller) and provides immediate visual confirmation that the FPGA is functional.
Because the boot screen writes to and reads from external SDRAM, a successful boot screen display also confirms that the SDRAM initialization sequence (mode register programming, initial precharge, and auto-refresh cycles) completed correctly.
The boot screen is implemented via pre-populated command FIFO entries (UNIT-002); see REQ-001.04 for the command FIFO pre-population requirement.
