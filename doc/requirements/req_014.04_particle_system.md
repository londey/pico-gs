# REQ-014.04: Particle System

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When the render executor processes a particle system render task, the system SHALL generate and submit camera-facing billboard quads (two triangles each) for each active particle, with per-particle position, size, color, and texture coordinates.

## Rationale

Particle systems enable visual effects (sparks, smoke, explosions, magic effects) by rendering large numbers of small, short-lived, camera-facing textured quads.
The host CPU manages particle lifetimes and physics; the GPU renders the resulting billboards as standard textured triangles.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-014 (Render Modes)

## Allocated To

TBD

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-020 (GPU Driver API)

## Verification Method

**Test:** TBD

## Notes

Placeholder requirement — details to be refined during implementation planning.
Particle update (spawn, age, physics) runs on the host CPU as part of the scene graph update.
