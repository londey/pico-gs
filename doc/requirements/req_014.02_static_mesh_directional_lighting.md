# REQ-014.02: Static Mesh with Directional Lighting

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When the render executor processes a mesh patch tagged as a directionally-lit static mesh, the system SHALL compute per-vertex lighting from up to 4 directional lights plus an ambient term, and configure the GPU with a single diffuse texture modulated by the interpolated vertex color.

## Rationale

Directionally-lit static meshes are used for objects that need real-time lighting response (e.g., rotating or moving objects) rather than pre-baked lightmaps.
Gouraud shading with directional lights provides acceptable visual quality at low computational cost on the host CPU.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-014 (Render Modes)

## Allocated To

TBD

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-020 (GPU Driver API)

## Verification Method

**Test:** TBD

## Notes

Placeholder requirement — details to be refined during implementation planning.
