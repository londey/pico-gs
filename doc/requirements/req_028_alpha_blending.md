# REQ-028: Alpha Blending [RETIRED]

## Status: RETIRED

**Retirement Date:** 2026-02-19
**Superseded By:** REQ-013 (Alpha Blending)
**Reason:** REQ-028 was a functional-format duplicate of REQ-013.
During the spec restructure into the 13-area hierarchy, duplicate requirements were consolidated.
REQ-013 is now the single canonical requirement for alpha blending under area 5 (Blend/Frame Buffer Store).
All content from REQ-028 has been absorbed into REQ-013.

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Retired
- **Verification:** N/A

## Original Requirement (archived)

The system SHALL implement alpha blending as specified in the functional requirements.

## Original Rationale

This requirement defined the functional behavior of the alpha blending subsystem.

## Allocated To (original)

- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)

## Interfaces (original)

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)

## Notes

This document is retained for traceability only.
Do not reference REQ-028 in new requirements or design documents.
Use REQ-013 for all alpha blending requirements.
