# REQ-013.03: VSync Synchronization

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When the GPU asserts the vsync signal on the GPIO status line (INT-013), the system SHALL synchronize the start of each new frame render to that vsync pulse, ensuring that the host does not begin submitting the next frame's commands until the GPU has completed scan-out of the current frame.

## Rationale

Vsync synchronization prevents tearing artifacts by ensuring the host and GPU agree on frame boundaries.
Without synchronization, the host may begin overwriting framebuffer data while the display controller is still scanning out pixels from that same buffer.
Gating frame submission on the vsync signal couples the render loop to the display refresh rate.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-006 (Screen Scan Out)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-022 (GPU Driver Layer)
- UNIT-021 (Core 1 Render Executor)

## Interfaces

- INT-020 (GPU Driver API)
- INT-013 (GPIO Status Signals)

## Verification Method

**Test:** Configure the GPU to output vsync pulses at the display refresh rate.
Verify that the host render loop advances to the next frame only after a vsync pulse is detected on the GPIO status line.
Verify that no register writes for frame N+1 occur before the vsync pulse that ends frame N.

## Notes

Previously allocated to UNIT-021 (Core 1 Render Executor); UNIT-021 reference removed pending single-threaded architecture consolidation.
