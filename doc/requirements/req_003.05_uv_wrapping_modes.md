# REQ-003.05: UV Wrapping Modes

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Demonstration

## Requirement

When a texture coordinate falls outside the normalized range [0, 1) during rasterization, the system SHALL apply the wrapping mode configured in TEXn_WRAP independently for U and V axes to determine the effective texel address before sampling.

## Rationale

UV wrapping modes enable textures to be tiled or clamped at boundaries, supporting both repeating patterns (like floor tiles) and single-use textures that should clamp or return transparent when accessed outside their bounds.

## Parent Requirements

REQ-003

## Allocated To

- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-014 (Texture Memory Layout)

## Verification Method

**Demonstration:** The system SHALL meet the following acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Set TEXn_CFG.U_WRAP and TEXn_CFG.V_WRAP fields independently
- [ ] Support REPEAT mode (wrap around, UV mod texture_size)
- [ ] Support CLAMP_TO_EDGE mode (clamp to [0, size-1])
- [ ] Support MIRROR mode (reflect at boundaries)
- [ ] Support OCTAHEDRAL mode (coupled diagonal mirroring for octahedral projection)
- [ ] U and V can have different wrap modes within the same texture unit
- [ ] Wrapping applies correctly for all texture dimensions

---


## Notes

Four wrapping modes are supported: REPEAT (UV mod texture_size), CLAMP_TO_EDGE (clamp to [0, size-1]), MIRROR (reflect at boundaries), and OCTAHEDRAL (coupled diagonal mirror for octahedral environment map unfolding).
U and V axes may have different wrap modes, configured independently via TEXn_CFG.U_WRAP and TEXn_CFG.V_WRAP.
Wrapping must be applied before texel address calculation and, for BC-family textures, must respect 4×4 block boundaries.
