# REQ-029: Memory Upload Interface [RETIRED]

## Status

**RETIRED** — This requirement has been merged into REQ-015 (Memory Upload Interface).
REQ-029 was a functional-form duplicate of the user-story-form REQ-015.
All content and acceptance criteria have been consolidated into REQ-015.

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Retired
- **Verification:** N/A

## Rationale for Retirement

REQ-029 and REQ-015 described the same capability (memory upload via MEM_ADDR/MEM_DATA registers) from two perspectives: user story and functional form.
As part of the 13-area requirement hierarchy restructure (2026-02-19), duplicate pairs are collapsed to a single canonical requirement.
REQ-015 is the surviving requirement and has been updated to incorporate the functional detail from REQ-029.
