# REQ-009.02: Gamepad Input

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When a USB gamepad or controller is connected, the system SHALL read button presses and analog stick values via USB HID and expose them through the `InputSource` trait alongside keyboard input.

## Rationale

Gamepad input provides a more natural control method for 3D scene navigation and demo interaction than keyboard input alone.
Supporting gamepads via the same `InputSource` abstraction keeps the input handling platform-agnostic.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-009 (Keyboard and Controller Input)

## Allocated To

TBD

## Interfaces

- INT-005 (USB HID Keyboard) — or a new gamepad HID interface

## Verification Method

**Test:** TBD

## Notes

Placeholder requirement — details to be refined during implementation planning.
The USB HID gamepad descriptor differs from the keyboard descriptor; a new interface document may be needed.
