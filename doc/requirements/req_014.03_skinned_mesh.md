# REQ-014.03: Skinned Mesh (3-Bone)

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When the render executor processes a mesh patch tagged as a skinned mesh, the system SHALL blend each vertex position across up to 3 bone transforms using per-vertex bone indices and weights before applying the standard model-view-projection transform and GPU submission.

## Rationale

Skinned meshes enable character animation by deforming vertex positions according to a bone hierarchy.
A 3-bone-per-vertex limit balances animation quality against the host CPU's per-vertex processing budget on RP2350.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-014 (Render Modes)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-023 (Transformation Pipeline) — bone-blended vertex transformation and MVP projection

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-020 (GPU Driver API)

## Verification Method

**Test:** TBD

## Notes

Placeholder requirement — details to be refined during implementation planning.
Bone animation data format and storage are not yet specified.
