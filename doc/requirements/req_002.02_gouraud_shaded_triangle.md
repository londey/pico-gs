# REQ-002.02: Gouraud Shaded Triangle

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Demonstration

## Requirement

When the firmware writes three VERTEX registers with TRI_MODE configured for Gouraud shading (GOURAUD=1), setting a distinct COLOR register value before each VERTEX write, the system SHALL interpolate color linearly across the triangle in screen space and write the interpolated RGBA8 color to each covered pixel.

## Rationale

Gouraud shading enables smooth per-vertex lighting gradients by linearly interpolating per-vertex colors across triangle surfaces.
This is the primary shading mode for diffuse lighting effects and smooth color transitions.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-002 (Rasterizer)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-004 (Triangle Setup)
- UNIT-005 (Rasterizer)
- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)

## Verification Method

**Demonstration:** The system SHALL meet the following acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Set TRI_MODE with GOURAUD=1
- [ ] Set COLOR register before each VERTEX write
- [ ] Colors interpolate linearly across triangle in screen space (RGBA8)
- [ ] With dithering enabled, smooth gradients visible in RGB565 framebuffer output
- [ ] With dithering disabled, quantization artifacts limited to RGB565 precision

## Notes

Derived from user story: As a firmware developer, I want to submit a triangle with per-vertex colors, so that I can render smooth lighting gradients.
