# REQ-003.02: Multi-Texture Rendering

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Demonstration

## Requirement

When the firmware configures two texture units (TEX0 and TEX1) with valid base addresses and formats, the system SHALL sample both textures during rasterization and provide both texture colors (TEX_COLOR0, TEX_COLOR1) as inputs to the color combiner stage.

## Rationale

Dual-texture rendering enables common multi-texture effects such as diffuse + lightmap, base texture + detail map, or environment mapping + diffuse in a single rendering pass.
This aligns with N64/GeForce2 MX-era dual-texture capabilities.
Effects requiring more than two textures (e.g., diffuse + lightmap + specular + detail) are achievable via multi-pass rendering.

## Parent Requirements

## Allocated To

- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)
- UNIT-010 (Color Combiner)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-014 (Texture Memory Layout)

## Functional Requirements

### FR-008-1: Dual Texture Unit Support

When the firmware enables one or both texture units via TEXn_CFG.ENABLE, the system SHALL support up to 2 independent texture units (TEX0 and TEX1), each with its own base address, format, dimensions, and UV coordinate registers (UV0, UV1).

### FR-008-2: Independent Texture Configuration

When a texture unit is configured, each unit SHALL independently specify:
- Enable, format, filter, dimensions, wrap mode, and mipmap levels (TEXn_CFG register)
- Base address in SDRAM (TEXn_CFG.BASE_ADDR field, 512-byte granularity)
- UV coordinates per vertex (UV0_UV1 register, packed)

### FR-008-3: Color Combiner Input

When both texture units are enabled, the system SHALL provide both sampled texture colors (TEX_COLOR0 from TEX0, TEX_COLOR1 from TEX1) as inputs to the color combiner stage (REQ-004.01).

### FR-008-4: Single Texture Fallback

When only TEX0 is enabled (TEX1 disabled), the system SHALL provide TEX_COLOR0 to the color combiner and treat TEX_COLOR1 as a neutral value (implementation-defined, typically white RGBA=1,1,1,1).

## Verification Method

**Demonstration:** The system SHALL meet the following acceptance criteria:

- [ ] Configure 2 independent texture units (TEX0, TEX1)
- [ ] Each texture unit configured independently via TEX0_CFG and TEX1_CFG registers
- [ ] Set UV0_UV1 register before each VERTEX write (packed U0/V0/U1/V1)
- [ ] Both enabled textures sample in a single draw call
- [ ] Textures can have different dimensions (e.g., 256×256 diffuse, 64×64 lightmap)
- [ ] Textures can have different formats (e.g., BC1 for diffuse, R8 for AO map)
- [ ] Single-texture mode works correctly when only TEX0 is enabled (TEX1_CFG.ENABLE=0)
- [ ] See INT-010 (GPU Register Map) for register details

## Notes

This requirement supersedes the previous 4-texture-unit specification.
The reduction from 4 to 2 texture units per pass enables larger per-unit texture caches (REQ-003.08) and simplifies the pipeline while maintaining sufficient capability for common multi-texture effects.
Effects previously requiring 4 simultaneous textures can be achieved through multi-pass rendering combined with the color combiner (REQ-004.01).
