# REQ-011: System Constraints

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Draft
- **Verification:** Inspection

## Requirement

The system SHALL run on an ICEpi Zero (ECP5-25K FPGA) and a Pico 2 (RP2350), meeting cross-cutting performance targets, FPGA resource budgets, and reliability requirements that apply across all subsystems.

## Rationale

The system constraints area groups non-functional requirements and platform constraints that span multiple subsystems.
The system must fit within the resource and performance envelope of the target hardware platforms.

## Parent Requirements

None (top-level area)

## Child Requirements

- REQ-011.01 (Performance Targets)
- REQ-011.02 (Resource Constraints)
- REQ-011.03 (Reliability Requirements)

## Notes

This is one of the top-level requirement areas organizing the specification hierarchy.
