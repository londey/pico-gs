# REQ-003.07: Texture Mipmapping

## Type

Functional

## Priority

Medium

## Classification

- **Priority:** Medium
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Demonstration

## Requirement

When a texture unit is configured with a mipmap chain (MIP_LEVELS > 1) and mipmapping is enabled, the system SHALL select and sample the appropriate mipmap level based on the screen-space rate of change of texture coordinates, enabling proper filtering of textured surfaces at varying distances from the camera.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-130-1: Mipmap Chain Storage

**Description**: The GPU SHALL support textures with mipmap chains consisting of the base level plus progressively downsampled levels down to 1x1 pixels.

**Details**:
- Mipmap levels stored sequentially in memory (base first, smallest last)
- Each level dimensions = max(base_dimension >> level, 1)
- For BC-family textures (BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4), minimum dimension per level is 4 pixels (BC block minimum)
- Maximum mipmap levels: 11 (for 1024×1024 down to 1×1)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Textures with 1-11 mipmap levels can be uploaded to GPU SDRAM
- Memory layout follows sequential organization per INT-014
- Firmware API supports mipmap count specification

### FR-130-2: LOD Selection

**Description**: The GPU SHALL automatically select the appropriate mipmap level (LOD - Level of Detail) based on screen-space texture coordinate derivatives.

**Details**:
- LOD = log₂(max(|du/dx|, |dv/dx|, |du/dy|, |dv/dy|))
- LOD clamped to range [0, mip_levels-1]
- LOD bias adjustable per texture unit (TEX0, TEX1) via TEXn_CFG.MIP_LEVELS and the LOD bias field in INT-010

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- LOD calculated per pixel based on derivatives
- LOD selection completes within 2 clock cycles (20 ns at 100 MHz `clk_core`)
- LOD bias shifts selection by -4.0 to +3.99 levels

### FR-130-3: Mipmap Addressing

**Description**: The GPU SHALL calculate the correct memory address for the selected mipmap level.

**Details**:
- Base address from TEXn_BASE register
- Mipmap level address = base + sum of sizes of all previous levels
- Size calculation accounts for block-compressed formats (BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4) and uncompressed formats (RGB565, RGBA8888, R8)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Address calculation hardware implemented in pixel pipeline
- Supports all formats defined in INT-014: BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4, RGB565, RGBA8888, R8
- No visual artifacts from incorrect addressing

### FR-130-4: Texture Filtering Modes

**Description**: The GPU SHALL support nearest-mip sampling (single mipmap level sampled with bilinear filtering).

**Details**:
- NEAREST: LOD rounded to nearest integer, no filtering within the mip level
- BILINEAR: 2×2 tap filter within the selected mip level
- TRILINEAR: blend between adjacent mip levels (requires MIP_LEVELS > 1); configured via TEXn_CFG.FILTER

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- NEAREST and BILINEAR modes produce artifact-free rendering
- TRILINEAR mode smoothly blends between adjacent mip levels with no visible seams
- Transition between mip levels in nearest mode occurs at LOD=N.5

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LOD calculation latency | <2 cycles (20 ns at 100 MHz) |
| Mipmap address calculation | <1 cycle (10 ns at 100 MHz) |
| Memory overhead | ~33% per texture |

## Parent Requirements

REQ-003

## Dependencies

- **INT-010**: GPU Register Map (TEXn_CFG.MIP_LEVELS, TEXn_CFG.FILTER)
- **INT-014**: Texture Memory Layout (mipmap chain specification)
- **INT-020**: GPU Driver API (mipmap upload functions)
- **UNIT-006**: Pixel Pipeline (LOD calculator, mipmap addressing logic)

## Notes

Mipmaps improve both visual quality (reduced aliasing) and performance (better cache locality for distant objects). The ~33% memory overhead is standard in GPU texturing.

Mipmapping applies to both texture units (TEX0 and TEX1) in the dual-texture architecture.
The larger per-unit texture cache (16K texels per sampler) improves mipmap cache locality since multiple mip levels for the same texture are more likely to remain resident.
