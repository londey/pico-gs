# REQ-012.01: PNG Asset Processing

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirements

**REQ-200.1:** When the asset build tool is given a PNG image file as input, it SHALL decode the image and convert all pixel data to RGBA8888 format suitable for GPU texture upload.

**REQ-200.2:** When the asset build tool decodes a PNG file, it SHALL validate that the image dimensions are power-of-two values in the range 8 to 1024 pixels on each axis, and SHALL reject inputs that violate these constraints with a descriptive error message identifying the invalid dimensions.

**REQ-200.3:** When the asset build tool processes a PNG file, it SHALL generate a sanitized Rust identifier derived from the source file path (using the immediate parent directory name and filename stem) to uniquely name the resulting texture asset.

## Rationale

The GPU hardware requires power-of-two texture dimensions and imposes minimum (8x8) and maximum (1024x1024) size limits. Validating these constraints at build time prevents runtime failures on the embedded target. Converting all input images to a uniform RGBA8888 format ensures a consistent data layout for the GPU driver's texture upload path.

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-012 (Game Data Preparation/Import)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-030 (PNG Decoder)
- UNIT-033 (Codegen Engine)

## Interfaces

- INT-003 (Texture Input Formats)
- INT-031 (Asset Binary Format)
- INT-030 (Asset Tool CLI Interface)

## Verification Method

**Test:** Unit tests verify power-of-two validation accepts valid dimensions (8x8, 256x256, 1024x512) and rejects non-power-of-two, undersized, and oversized inputs. Integration tests confirm end-to-end PNG loading produces correct RGBA8888 byte output with expected data length (width * height * 4).

## Notes

The implementation uses the `image` crate to decode PNG files and convert to RGBA8 regardless of the source color format. Identifier generation includes the parent directory name to namespace textures (e.g., `textures/player.png` becomes `TEXTURES_PLAYER`), with collision detection across all assets in a build.
