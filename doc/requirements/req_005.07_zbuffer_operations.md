# REQ-005.07: Z-Buffer Operations

## Classification

- **Priority:** Essential
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Test

## Requirement

When Z_TEST_EN=1 and a fragment's interpolated depth value is compared against the Z-buffer using the configured Z_COMPARE function, the system SHALL pass the fragment and, when Z_WRITE_EN=1, update the Z-buffer with the new depth value; otherwise the system SHALL discard the fragment without modifying the Z-buffer or color buffer.

When Z_RANGE is configured with Z_RANGE_MIN and Z_RANGE_MAX values, the system SHALL discard any fragment whose interpolated Z value falls outside [Z_RANGE_MIN, Z_RANGE_MAX] before performing the depth comparison.

## Rationale

This requirement defines the functional behavior of the Z-buffer operations subsystem, including depth range clipping and Z-buffer write control.
The Z-buffer tile cache (UNIT-006) absorbs most Z read/write traffic; only cache misses and evictions generate SDRAM accesses via the arbiter (UNIT-007).

## Parent Requirements

- REQ-005 (Blend/Frame Buffer Store)

## Allocated To

- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)
- UNIT-007 (Memory Arbiter)
- UNIT-005 (Rasterizer)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-011 (SDRAM Memory Layout)

## Verification Method

**Test:** Execute relevant test suite for Z-buffer operations.

- [ ] Depth comparison produces correct pass/fail results for all 8 compare functions (LESS, LEQUAL, EQUAL, GEQUAL, GREATER, NOTEQUAL, ALWAYS, NEVER)
- [ ] When Z_WRITE_EN=1, passing fragments update the Z-buffer with the new depth value
- [ ] When Z_WRITE_EN=0, the Z-buffer is not modified regardless of depth test result
- [ ] When Z_RANGE is configured to a sub-range, fragments outside [Z_RANGE_MIN, Z_RANGE_MAX] are discarded before depth test
- [ ] When Z_RANGE_MIN=0x0000 and Z_RANGE_MAX=0xFFFF, all fragments proceed to depth test (full range passthrough)

## Notes

The Z-buffer stores 16-bit unsigned depth values (0 = near, 0xFFFF = far) in 4×4 block-tiled layout identical to the framebuffer format (INT-011).
Z-buffer addresses use the same block-tiled address calculation as framebuffer pixel addresses.
