# REQ-003.01: Textured Triangle

## Classification

- **Priority:** Important
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Verification:** Demonstration

## Requirement

When the firmware writes three VERTEX registers with TRI_MODE configured for texture mapping (TEXTURED=1), the system SHALL rasterize a triangle with UV coordinates interpolated across the surface and sample texture data at each pixel using the configured texture unit.

## Rationale

Texture mapping is essential for realistic rendering, allowing surface detail without increasing geometric complexity. It enables: realistic materials (wood, metal, stone), decals and labels, sprite rendering for UI, and efficient detail representation (one 256×256 texture = 65,536 triangles of flat-shaded detail).

## Parent Requirements

REQ-003

## Allocated To

- UNIT-005 (Rasterizer)
- UNIT-006 (Pixel Pipeline)

## Interfaces

- INT-010 (GPU Register Map)
- INT-011 (SDRAM Memory Layout)
- INT-014 (Texture Memory Layout)

## Verification Method

**Demonstration:** The system SHALL meet the following acceptance criteria:

- - [ ] Set TRI_MODE with TEXTURED=1
- [ ] Set TEX_BASE to texture address in SDRAM
- [ ] Set TEX_FMT with texture dimensions (power-of-two, log2 encoded)
- [ ] Set UV register (U/W, V/W, 1/W) before each VERTEX write
- [ ] Texture sampling is perspective-correct (no affine warping)
- [ ] Texture coordinates wrap or clamp (configurable)
- [ ] Final pixel = texture color × vertex color

---


## Notes

Texture mapping requires both geometric data (vertices) and UV coordinates.
The GPU supports up to 2 simultaneous texture units (REQ-003.02) with a programmable color combiner (REQ-004.01).
